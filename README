Podcast downloader is a tool for automatic download of podcast feeds formated with "Media RSS" and itunes podcasts dtd.

The tool was written to download podcasts from LBC (lbc.co.uk) and includes some custom logic to reformat file name, which 
will need to be changed to adapt the tool to other providers. But with 2.5h of James O'Brien (http://www.lbc.co.uk/james-obrien-3537) 
a day who needs other podcasts?

Tested with feed defined as:
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">
